This is a super simple game created using the `<canvas>` element while on a 
train ride between VIC and LWS. <small>Google the stations in the UK if 
you're intersted</small>

The game starts immediately on load. You are the red square, anything white 
is your enemy. Avoid it at all costs.

## Controls
* You can either follow the mouse around the screen *(beware the insta-death)*. **OR**
* You can use the arrow keys to move. *Consider this expert mode as its a 
lot slower than using the mouse to move.*
